This is a simple blogging app backend built with FastAPI.
This project is created to simulate a real CRUD blogging system.
It is built to be used by several system hence adopting the REST APIs aproach.
Just like all REST APIs you can perform all functions of this system using the endpoints we created.
Everything is simple and easy to use no need to read the code to understand, though you can still jump in there to 
make some modifications.
